\title{Plot coefficient paths from sequential estimation}
\usage{
plot_coef(x, var)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A fitted object class \code{distr.seq.fit}.}

\item{var}{A character string specifying the variable name in the coefficient path
to be plotted (must be a column name in \code{coef_path}, see
\code{\link{distr_seq_ana}}).}
}
\value{
A plot is generated as a side effect. The function does not return a value.
}
\description{
This function plots the estimated coefficient path of a specified variable across
multiple sequential fits. It handles coefficient paths of unequal lengths by padding
them with \code{NA}s.
}
\details{
The function collects the coefficient trajectories of the selected variable from each
sequential fit. Since the trajectories may vary in length, the function pads them with
\code{NA}s to align their lengths and uses \code{matplot()} to plot them on the same graph.
A horizontal dashed line is added to indicate the final estimated coefficient value.
