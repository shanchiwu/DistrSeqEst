Description: Provides tools to conduct and integrate multiple adaptive sequential estimation procedures across distributed or parallel computing environments. The methodology is designed for large-scale data applications, combining confidence set estimation, beta-protection inference, and active learning principles. The implemented algorithms are based on the frameworks proposed by Chen et al. (2024, Canadian Journal of Statistics) and Chen, Wang & Chang (2020, Biometrics). For theoretical background, see <https://doi.org/10.1002/cjs.11762> and <https://doi.org/10.1111/biom.13160>.
