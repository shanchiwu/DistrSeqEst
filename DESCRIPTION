Description: 
    Provides tools to conduct and integrate multiple adaptive sequential estimation procedures 
    across distributed or parallel computing environments. The methodology is designed for 
    large-scale data applications, combining confidence set estimation, beta-protection inference, 
    and active learning principles. The implemented algorithms are based on the frameworks 
    proposed by Chen et al. (2024, Canadian Journal of Statistics) and Wang & Chang (2017, 
    Biometrika). For theoretical background, see <doi:10.1002/cjs.11762> and <doi:10.1093/biomet/asx028>.
